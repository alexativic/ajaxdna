        <h2>Purpose</h2>
WhereStartup aims to help entreprenurial pople who want to change the world to get started at entrepreneurship. And avobe all, transmit the idea that against popular belief, we are far from having invented everything yet. 
 
        <h3>Structure of the articles</h3>
        <p>WhereStartup is a blog where different problems that the world faces will be given exposure to everyone who wants to read them. But the purpose of the blog is not just to manifest these problems. But rather, help you make use of them, that is why we will quantify them in terms of people affected (social impact), economic terms (economic impact) or sustainability terms (environmental impact). Feel free to use these data in your pitch, just be sure to cite the correct trustworthy and public sources we used. But exposing just problems won't make it, sometimes enthusiastic people know that they want to change the world but don't know how, so that is why all posts will also include innovative solutions where you could start at to startup. That being said, these solutions have not currently changed the world because they have their own specific problems. Your task as entrepreneur? Finding and fixing those specific problems or make something disruptive so that those specific problems do not even exist anymore. Also, don't forget to check if someone wants to pay for solving that problem... </p>

        <h3>Expansion of the blog</h3>
        <p>As we grow, we will try to make articles with clients who know that they have a problem and who want to pay so that it can be solved. We believe that this will help a lot entrepreneurial careers since the focus will be much clearer. As we expand, we will also facilitate other communication vias as social networks and different communication formats, as videos or shorts</p>

	<h3>Economics of the blog</h3>
	<p>For the moment the blog gains money from people who start a company and contacts us to ask for help while writting a proposal for funding through local or international projects. There exist other types of collaborations that are beneficial for the blog as we can expand our work on a certain article or topic if you are interested in knowing more specific problems, solutions or want too get a deeper understanding. We will writte a repport for you, and even help you to execute your project if it is what you need. But mostly this is a divulgation blog which reflects the interest of the AJAX DNA founders to share their passion for translational science and entrepreneurship. </p>
