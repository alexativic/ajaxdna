            <h2>Hello there!</h2>
            <p>
                I’m Alejandro Atienza Vicedo, and it's great to see you here! I am the founder and CEO of AJAX DNA, and as part of my journey, I started writing this blog 
                <strong>WhereStartup?</strong>. Here, I’ve combined my passion for innovation and entrepreneurship with my scientific background, hoping 
                to inspire people like you to make a difference in the world. As a side note, I am a big hiking and Star Wars fan, so expect to see some metaphors and pop culture references!
            </p>

            <h3>Let’s Connect</h3>
            <p>
                If you’ve got an idea, a question, a collaboration in mind, want to execute a project inside your company or make it more sustainable—or you just need a biotech guy in your life—I’d love to hear from you! 
                Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandro-atienza-vicedo/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. 
                Let’s explore how we can create meaningful change together.
            </p>

            <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
            <p>
                People who know me say I’m chaotic, but I prefer to say that I’m never bored. I’ve always been fascinated by how science and technology can solve real-world 
                problems. As a kid, I was captivated by Leonardo da Vinci’s inventions and how they still impact the world we live in today. Along my pathway into innovation, entrepreneurship, and invention, I’ve received the <strong>Bioval Young Award in Biotechnology in 2024</strong>. I was also granted entry to the <strong>AgrotecUV incubator</strong>, where I collaborate with amazing minds to develop high-tech solutions for agriculture and industry. Most recently, our work at AJAX DNA was awarded the <strong>First Prize at the UPV Ideas XVIII Entrepreneurship 
                Competition</strong>. I want to thank all the previous collaborators and you, the reader, for the confidence you’re placing in me.
            </p>

            <h3>My Academic Background</h3>
            <p>
                None of this would have been possible without the people and institutions that helped me during my education. I studied at the <strong>Technical University of Valencia (UPV)</strong>, where I developed my passion for biotechnology. Later, I did my Erasmus at the <strong>École supérieure de biotechnologie de Strasbourg (ESBS)</strong>, where I rediscovered synthetic biology and entrepreneurship. Back in Valencia, and thanks to UPV, I was selected as part of the first class of <strong>CDTM VLC</strong> (Center for Digital Technology 
                and Management in Valencia) students, a community that has taught me how to turn ideas into impactful projects. I’m now a second-year master’s student in the CSIC Master’s program on Synthetic Biology, which provided me with both the time and tools to pursue my scientific and entrepreneurial career.
